erlang-style mailbox/msg passing for js

i have many problems with concurrency in single threaded javascript

[i was reading about threads and messaging and inbox and selective retreival of incoming messages in erlang ie different priority messages and how it worked](http://ndpar.blogspot.co.uk/2010/11/erlang-explained-selective-receive.html)

processes are isolated, errors contained

i dont know much about erlang, but it looked similar to [fowler's statemachines](http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1592379) which i like

todo
from fowler's blog: 
example json statemachine

todo
how it could be in erlang style

it doesn't just look similar- it's much better!
even though in erlang it's purpose is to communicate between threads, could this help in single threaded concurrent javascript?

suggestions, comments, feddback, help welcome and appreciated
